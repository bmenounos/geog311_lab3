Please **DO NOT** mark on the original photos, but you are welcome to mark up the photocopied ones! Please work in groups of two people. \n",

    "Also included with these photos are NTDB 1:50,000 map names that you can use to find the slide location on the [BC Land Data BC website](http://geobc.gov.bc.ca/base-mapping/imagery/topographic.html)\n",

    "a) [10 points] Determine the approximate scale of the photography using\n",
    "  the BC mapping website. Identify landslide type for each photo set based on morphology. Classify whether the landslide is active or inactive. Provide details of any geomorphic features present in the air photos that may provide clues to terrain stability. Include your names on the back of the photos (the photocopies) or tracing paper so I can assign a grade to everyone. Make sure everyone gets a chance to do some of the air photo mapping. **Note: The Big Bend photo pairs represent the same failure in 1953 and 2005**.\n",
    "\n",
    "b) [20 points] Map the extent of the landslides on the copies of the photos. Make sure to limit your mapping to the portion \\textbf{in stereo only}. Since several photo sets have more than two photos, **limit mapping to the pair where landslides are most prevalent**. Be sure to write your name and photo numbers used at lower right of photos. Include any additional features which help to verify your choice for A. Also trace roads, river thalweg or lakes for reference. Use dashed lines to denote uncertain or vague boundaries, solid lines for well defined contacts. Do mapping in pencil or water soluble pens as you may need to erase your work. **DO NOT** mark original air photos or you will have to purchase (\\$10 per photo). \n",
    "\n",
    "c) [10 points]Consider the prominent failure on the Big Bend Photo Pair\n",
    "  (Quesnel). Determine the area of the failure using the BC mapping website tools (or use the nominal scale of the photos). Note that the ortho image displayed for this region is from 2005 and corresponds to the color photo pair that you have. \n",
    "\n",
    "d) [10 points] What has been the rate ($m~yr^{-1}$) of headward\n",

    "Analysis of directional data often reveals information about the type or nature of geomorphic processes. For example, large-scale lithologic structures (e.g. anticline) and bedding planes may explain the spatial distribution of rock avalanches. It is therefore important to investigate whether landslides show a preferred orientation. To work with directional data, however, one can not simply take the 'average' of circular data expressed in degrees (e.g. consider the average direction of the compass bearings 350 $^{\\circ}$,  355 $^{\\circ}$, and 23$^{\\circ}$ ). To determine statistical parameters such as central tendency and dispersion, we must convert the observations to vectors and plot them on a unit circle. A compass direction can be converted into polar coordinates by the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\begin{split}\n",
    "x_{i} &= cos(\\theta_{i}) \\\\\n",
    "y_{i} &= sin(\\theta_{i}) \\\\\n",
    "\\end{split}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $x_{i}$ and $y_{i}$ represent the X and Y coordinates of the unit vector and $\\theta_{i}$ is the compass direction (in radians).\n",
    "\n",
    "Mean direction for a set of 2-D vectors can be obtained by computing the vector resultant:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\begin{split}\n",
    "X_{r} &= \\sum^{n}_{i=1} cos(\\theta_{i}) \\\\ \n",
